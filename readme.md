### Archivation note [START]
I wrote the stuff in this repository while teaching the basic concepts of programming and the C# programming language specifically at Riga Coding School.

This code is what was developed together with the students during class. This does not contain the examples I coded and materials I wrote for the course. If you are interested in seeing those, contact me, and I'll try to dig them up. 

Since the course has ended, I don't plan on adding anything to it.

### Archivation note [END]

This repository is for study purposes.
